# OrcaDump
This is a repository for me to examples of projects I made while learning Orca.
Right now there isn't much of anything in here, but the hopes is that this repository will slowly be populated with things I learn.

To run these examples you need to have gone through the installation process for Orca found here: https://github.com/orca-app/orca

Afterwords, you need to cd into the example and execute the following in a terminal: ./run.bat

These examples are meant to be built on windows, however they should work on linux by making a .sh version of run.bat.

run.bat: This is just a batch file that executes 3 commands: build, bundle, and runing the executable.
You can open up any run.bat and see those three commands. Just use the bash equivilent and it should work fine -- Copilot can probably just convert it to bash.
